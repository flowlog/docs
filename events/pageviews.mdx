## Description

A pageview event refers to tracking when a user views a specific page on a website or application. It is a common type of event that provides valuable information about user behavior and engagement. When a pageview event occurs, various properties related to user interaction are captured, such as the browser and device they are using, the URL of the page, the timestamp of the event, and geographic information such as the user's location.

### Properties

<ResponseField name="browser" type="auto[]">
  An array of the anchors, includes the `icon`, `color`, and `url`.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="timestamp" type="auto[]">

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="system" type="auto[]">

### Usage

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
