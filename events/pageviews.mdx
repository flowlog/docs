## Description

A pageview event refers to tracking when a user views a specific page on a website or application. It is a common type of event that provides valuable information about user behavior and engagement. When a pageview event occurs, various properties related to user interaction are captured, such as the browser and device they are using, the URL of the page, the timestamp of the event, and geographic information such as the user's location.

### Properties

On every pageview event, flowlog automatically capture the following properties:

<ResponseField name="$browser" type="auto">
  Browser information, including the browser's name, version, and engine.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="$timestamp" type="auto">
  Timestamp data, indicating specific dates and times of events or actions.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="$system" type="auto">
  System information, detailing the operating system, architecture, and other
  relevant system details.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="$device" type="auto">
  Device information, including the type of device, model, and manufacturer.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="$geolocation" type="auto">
  Geolocation data, providing coordinates (latitude and longitude), city, and
  country information.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="$distinct_id" type="auto">
  Unique identifiers, typically used to track individual users or entities
  across sessions or interactions.
</ResponseField>
