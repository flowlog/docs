## Description

An "identify" event in product analytics is a critical type of event that is used to track and record the identity of a user interacting with a digital product. This event is pivotal for connecting all of a user's actions and behaviors to a unique identifier, enabling a cohesive analysis of user behavior over time across different sessions, devices, or platforms.

When an identify event is triggered, it usually involves capturing a distinct user ID (which can be an anonymous ID, email address, or any other unique identifier) and potentially a set of user attributes (like demographics, preferences, and behaviors). This information is then used to create or update a user profile in the analytics system. The purpose is to maintain a continuous and integrated view of how individual users interact with the product, which is invaluable for personalization, targeted marketing, customer service, and overall user experience enhancements.

The identify event is crucial for:

#### Attributing actions to users

It ensures that every action taken on the platform can be attributed to the same user across different sessions and devices, even if they log out and return later or switch from mobile to desktop.

#### Segmentation and Personalization

By associating specific attributes and behaviors with identified users, companies can segment their user base for more targeted analysis, communication, and personalization strategies.

### Lifetime Value Tracking

It allows for the analysis of a user's interactions with the product over their entire lifecycle, providing insights into user retention, lifetime value, and churn.
Implementing the identify event typically involves calling a specific function in the product analytics SDK (Software Development Kit) whenever a user signs up, logs in, or updates their profile information. This function call includes the unique user ID and any relevant user attributes to be associated with that ID.

By effectively using identify events, organizations can greatly enhance their understanding of user behavior, improve user engagement, and drive more informed product development and marketing decisions.

### Recomended custom properties

Flowlog follows Segment reserved traits that have semantic meanings for users, and will handle them in special ways. For example, Segment always expects email to be a string of the userâ€™s email address. Segment sends this on to destinations like Mailchimp that require an email address for their tracking.
